### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ My name is Tianyi Shao and I am a dev on the rise

I am a full-stack engineer currently looking for employment. My skills include:
- Javascript
  - Express.js
  - Sequelize.js
  - Node.js
  - React.js
  - Redux
- Python
  - Flask
  - SQLAlchemy
Currently I am working on:
- Improving the features and design of my previous web apps
- Learning C/C++ for the time being for development of multithreaded apps
- Acquiring more skills in UI/UX utilizing tools like Adobe Creative Cloud

A little about me:
With a background in Mathematics/Financial Actuarial Sciences, I am an individual with very strong interest in solving real-life problems with quantitative methods; my passion in philosophy and modal logic have provided me with a strong capability in deep-level analysis and design. I have also been affluent with conventions in the field of business (which includes marketing, finance, and a certain level of operations management) and they have provided me more insight into how products should focus more on their competencies. With an utterly high level of attention to details, I am pretty good at providing situational analysis, and I can usually solve problems in an effective and efficient way in a relatively short span of time.

Anyway, nice to meet you and please feel free to take a glance!
